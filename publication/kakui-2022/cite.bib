 abstract = {Invisible screen-camera communication is promising in that it does not interfere with the video viewing experience. In the imperceptible color vibration method, which displays two colors of the same luminance alternately at high speed for each pixel, embedded information is decoded by taking the difference between distant frames on the time axis. Therefore, the interframe differences of the original video contents affect the decoding performance. In this study, we propose a decoding method which utilizes simultaneously captured images using a dual-camera smartphone with different exposure times. This allows taking the color difference between the frames that are close to each other on the time axis. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated through several application examples.},
