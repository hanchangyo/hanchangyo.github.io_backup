 abstract = {This paper introduces BumpMarker: a 3D-printed tangible marker that can perform simultaneous tagging, position tracking, and weight measurement of objects on pressure sensor sheets. The markers baseplate features several pins (raised dots) whose locations encode embedded information. A matrix pressure sensor sheet captures the pressure map of a marker-attached object on a sheet. The embedded data and object weight can be retrieved by processing the pressure map. We propose our design to achieve robust detection of the pins. We also show that our system has the ability to monitor weight changes in tagged objects. Through a series of evaluations, we investigate the technical feasibility of BumpMarker.},
