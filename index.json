However, the interface of the synthesizer is not intuitive enough and require extra knowledge because of the parameters. To address this problem, we propose pseudo-intention learning: a novel data collection method for supervised learning in musical instrument development. Pseudo-intention learning collects a data set of the paired target tone and input performed by the user. We developed a conversion framework that reflects the composer's intention by combining standard convolutional neural network and pseudo-intention learning. As a proof of concept, we constructed an interface that can freely manipulate the sound source of a digital snare drum and demonstrated its effectiveness with a pilot study. We confirmed that the tone parameters generated by our system reflected the user's intention. We also discuss applying this method to richer musical expression.","tags":["Drum","Music","Musical instrument","Neural networks","Supervised learning"],"title":"An Intuitive Interface for Digital Synthesizer by Pseudo-intention Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changyo Han","Takeshi Naemura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686898998,"objectID":"b55d16cd7d7107dc4d8ad51352c3f213","permalink":"https://hanchangyo.github.io/publication/han-2019-bump-marker/","publishdate":"2023-06-16T07:03:18.657417Z","relpermalink":"/publication/han-2019-bump-marker/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces BumpMarker: a 3D-printed tangible marker that can perform simultaneous tagging, position tracking, and weight measurement of objects on pressure sensor sheets. The markers baseplate features several pins (raised dots) whose locations encode embedded information. A matrix pressure sensor sheet captures the pressure map of a marker-attached object on a sheet. The embedded data and object weight can be retrieved by processing the pressure map. We propose our design to achieve robust detection of the pins. We also show that our system has the ability to monitor weight changes in tagged objects.

We demonstrate the improvement of the transmission performance based on tone-reservation technique in a multiple intermediatefrequency-over-fiber (IFoF) based mobile fronthaul. The tone-reservation technique can suppress nonlinear distortion by eliminating the high peak components of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. To prevent the regrowth of peak, we employ tone-reservation after multiplexing IF carriers. Furthermore, we use an out-of-band signal as the reserved tones to avoid any modification of a mobile signal. The impact of the number of IF carriers on peak-To-Average power ratio (PAPR) characteristics is presented via numerical simulation. For the multi-IFoF based mobile fronthaul, we experimentally investigate the transmission performance of 36-IF carriers of the long term evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) signals mapped with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). It is clearly observed that the clipping-induced nonlinear distortion is dramatically suppressed by using tone-reservation. As a result, the transmission performance of 36-IF carriers of the LTE-A signal is improved by an error-vector-magnitude (EVM) of 4% (from 9.7% to 5.7%) after 20-km transmission.","tags":[],"title":"Improvement of the transmission performance in multi-IF-over-fiber mobile fronthaul by using tone-reservation technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changyo Han","Seung-Hyun Cho","Hwan Seok Chung","Jong Hyun Lee"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686899005,"objectID":"4e0f5074a3a337b05ca0766af257c353","permalink":"https://hanchangyo.github.io/publication/han-2015/","publishdate":"2023-06-16T07:03:25.127423Z","relpermalink":"/publication/han-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"We demonstrate linearity improvement of directly-modulated multi-IF-over-fibre links using a simple shunt diode predistorter.

All the circuits presented by the authors were designed using narrow transmission line with a 6 $μ$m signal line width. Because the phase constant of a narrow transmission line is larger, impedance matching is achieved using a much shorter line length compared with matching using a wider transmission line. Single-stage amplifiers utilizing narrow and wide transmission lines were fabricated and compared in 65nm CMOS process. Use of narrow transmission lines can reduce layout area by 60% while achieving a measured power gain of 6.54 dB, a measured output power at 1 dB compression point of 4.35dBm and a measured saturated output power of 8.0 dB.","tags":["60 GHz","CMOS","Transmission line","power amplifiers"],"title":"Area Reduction of Millimeter-Wave CMOS Amplifier Using Narrow Transmission Line","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Minami","Changyo Han","Kota Matsushita","Kenichi Okada","Akira Matsuzawa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686899009,"objectID":"704dddac8af6bfa20c4729e965f5cdbe","permalink":"https://hanchangyo.github.io/publication/minami-2011/","publishdate":"2023-06-16T07:03:29.593868Z","relpermalink":"/publication/minami-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper discusses about device characterization for mmW transceiver design.
